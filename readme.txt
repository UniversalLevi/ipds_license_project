🧩 What Are We Building? (Simple Explanation)

You are building a secure license system for software products. Here’s how it works, step by step:

---

1. RSA Key Management
- What: Generate a pair of cryptographic keys (private and public).
- Why: The private key is used to sign licenses (proves they’re real). The public key is used to verify them (proves they’re not fake).
- How: Use a Python script to generate and save these keys.

---

 2. Database Setup
- What: MySQL database with 4 tables:
  - `users` (who can get licenses)
  - `products` (what software is licensed)
  - `licenses` (who has what license, for how long)
  - `license_logs` (records every license check)
- How: Use the provided `database.sql` to create tables and add test data.

---

 3. License API Server
- What: A web server (using FastAPI or Flask) that:
  - Receives user details from the agent (username, password, product ID, etc.)
  - Checks if the user and product exist and are valid in the database.
  - If valid, creates a license JSON, signs it with the private key, and sends it back.
  - Logs every license generation/check in the database.
- How: Write Python code to connect to MySQL, handle requests, and sign licenses.

---

 4. License JSON Format & Signing
- What: The license is a JSON file with fields like customer name, product, license key, dates, and a digital signature.
- How: The API server creates this JSON, generates a unique license key, signs the JSON (except the signature field) with the private key, and adds the signature.

---

 5. Agent CLI Tool
- What: A command-line tool (runs on the client’s computer) that:
  - Asks the user for their details (name, username, product ID, password, etc.) interactively.
  - Sends these details to the API server.
  - If the server says “OK,” saves the license JSON file somewhere safe on the client’s system.
- How: Write a Python script using `input()` for user prompts and `requests` to talk to the API.

---

 6. License Verifier
- What: A tool (can be part of the agent or separate) that:
  - Reads the saved license JSON file.
  - Uses the public key to check the digital signature (proves it’s real).
  - Checks if the license is expired or revoked.
  - Optionally, can re-check with the server for extra security.
- How: Write a Python script to load the license, verify the signature, and check the fields.

---

 7. License Logging
- What: Every time a license is generated or checked, the server logs it in the `license_logs` table (who, what, when, status, IP).
- How: Add code in the API server to insert a log entry for each event.

---

 🔄 How It All Works Together

1. You generate RSA keys (private for server, public for agent).
2. You set up the MySQL database using the schema.
3. You run the API server (it uses the private key and talks to the database).
4. The agent CLI runs on the client:
   - User enters their info.
   - Agent sends info to API server.
   - If valid, server creates and signs a license, sends it back.
   - Agent saves the license file.
5. The verifier tool (on the client) checks the license file’s signature and validity.
6. The server logs every license event for auditing and security.

 📝 What You Need to Build (in order)

1. RSA key generator script (Python)
2. MySQL database setup (run the provided SQL)
3. API server (Python, FastAPI/Flask, MySQL, signing logic)
4. Agent CLI tool (Python, interactive, talks to API, saves license)
5. Verifier tool (Python, checks license file and signature)
6. Logging in API server (add to API code)
